## Risk Summary

**High Risk Issues:** 0 (down from 6) ✅  
**Medium Risk Issues:** 3 (down from 8) ⚠️  
**Low Risk Issues:** 4 (down from 7) ℹ️  
**Total Issues:** 7 (down from 21)

---

## ✅ Resolved High Risk Issues

### 1. SSRF Vulnerability ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** URL validation with private IP blocking, protocol validation
- **Verification:** All 10 SSRF tests passed

### 2. Missing Authentication Checks ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** All API endpoints now verify authentication
- **Verification:** All unauthenticated requests return 401

### 3. Client-Side User ID Trust ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** Server uses session-based user ID exclusively
- **Verification:** userId removed from request body handling

### 4. No Rate Limiting ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** Redis-based rate limiting implemented
- **Limits:**
  - Chat: 10 requests/minute
  - Image processing: 5 requests/minute
  - Recipe storage: 5 requests/minute
- **Verification:** ✅ Rate limiting using Redis (Upstash) confirmed

### 5. Insufficient File Upload Validation ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** Size limits, MIME validation, content validation with Sharp
- **Verification:** File validation tests passing

### 6. Weak Password Policy ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Fix:** 12+ characters, complexity requirements, common password blocking
- **Verification:** Password policy tests passing

---

## ⚠️ Remaining Medium Risk Issues

### 7. Error Message Sanitization
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Partially addressed  
**Description:** Some error messages still return detailed information

**Current State:**
- Database errors return `error.message` directly
- Some internal paths/stack traces may leak

**Recommendation:**
- Create centralized error handler
- Return generic messages to clients
- Log detailed errors server-side only

**Impact:** Low (errors are less user-friendly but don't expose critical data)

---

### 8. Request Size Limits
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Not configured at Next.js level  
**Description:** No explicit body size limits in Next.js config

**Current State:**
- Input length validation exists (10k/50k chars)
- No Next.js bodyParser size limit configured

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '10mb',
    },
  },
}
```

**Impact:** Low (length validation already prevents most abuse)

---

### 9. CSRF Protection
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Partially protected (Supabase handles some)  
**Description:** No explicit CSRF tokens

**Current State:**
- Supabase uses secure cookies
- Next.js provides some CSRF protection
- No explicit CSRF tokens

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding explicit CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Ensure SameSite cookie settings are correct

**Impact:** Low (Supabase and Next.js provide baseline protection)

---

## ℹ️ Remaining Low Risk Issues

### 10. Missing Request Logging/Monitoring
**Severity:** Low  
**Recommendation:** Set up monitoring (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)

### 11. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
**Severity:** Low  
**Recommendation:** Add `npm audit` to CI/CD, set up Dependabot

### 12. Enhanced CORS Configuration
**Severity:** Low  
**Recommendation:** Explicit CORS headers if needed for cross-origin

### 13. Environment Variable Validation
**Severity:** Low  
**Recommendation:** Create validation utility (nice to have)
